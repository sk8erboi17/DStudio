# Grove: application recipes

## Before markup
Write a one-sentence visual thesis and the user's primary action. Choose a topology from the information hierarchy, then bind this pack's tokens. If alternatives are requested, vary spatial hierarchy and density, not only the accent color.

## Primary recipe
Nav → hero split (welcome and reassurance list | task card with steps, choice tiles, live status and one primary action) → three-step path → questions with a person to contact. Below 980px the task card follows the welcome.

## Adaptation
For onboarding, the task card holds one question at a time. For appointments, tiles hold days, then times. For a service directory, the path becomes eligibility steps.

## Responsive and long content
Tiles drop to one column below 560px; the path turns vertical with its connector on the left. Use minmax(0,1fr), min-width:0 and overflow-wrap for user text. Do not put content in horizontal scroll regions; reflow rows into labelled stacks instead. Test a long title and translated button text at 320px and 200% text.

## Honest interaction
Loading: a progress element with a real value or an explicitly indeterminate state. Empty: explain what is missing and offer an implemented next action. Error: keep entered values, say what happened and associate guidance with the control. Success: confirm only what was actually done. Say what happens next before it happens; offer a person when the page cannot help.

## Export
Copy the needed CSS and JS beside the generated entry file and update relative paths. The lab toolbar belongs to the catalog only; omit it from client work. No CDN, remote font, brand imitation or borrowed component package is required.

## Turn this recipe into a project

Treat the supplied layout and breakpoints as examples. First identify the primary
operation and choose a reading/action order for this brief; remove sample identity
and irrelevant lab controls. For a second direction, change the topology, density
or type roles in response to a different need, while keeping the system's thesis.

Use the state-coverage design-plan reference to map each visible action to its
validated change and observable result. Include invalid input, no results, Back,
cancellation and repeated use where applicable. Keep user text literal and name
what survives a reload. Test the resulting local export with network unavailable,
then record actual findings and remaining gaps; the recipe is not a test receipt.
