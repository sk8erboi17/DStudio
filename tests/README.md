# Tests: what each result actually proves

Correctness before performance. No test is accepted merely because a function
name, comment, prompt phrase or CSS declaration occurs in application source.

| Directory | Executes | Does not prove |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unit/` | Production functions with controlled inputs and checked outputs | A model answered correctly |
| `browser/` | Real browser interactions, usually with simulated engine responses | Real model inference or real downloads |
| `integration/` | Tools, files, subprocesses, HTTP, build lifecycle | Model quality unless real weights are explicitly loaded |
| `live/` | Explicit network, hardware and/or real-model runs | All models, platforms or workloads are correct |
| `support/`, `fixtures/` | Shared harnesses and controlled input data | Independent test results |

## Clean installation and real inference

```sh
make test-setup-live                  # Real GitHub downloads + builds: main, Laguna, Qwen3.8, Qwen3.6
make test-first-launch-e2e            # Headless .app + real WebKit UI + fresh network engine installation
make test-inference-live              # Real resident Metal: installed DeepSeek + Laguna
make test-inference-live ENGINES=qwen  # Requires downloaded Qwen base + PLE
make test-engine-acceptance           # Fresh builds AND real inference for all four engines
make test-qwen-chat-live              # Actual DStudio launch + Chat HTTP proxy, real Qwen
make benchmark-qwen-decode            # Native generation tok/s, three exact-output checks
```

The setup gate calls DStudio's production headless installer, using the same
archive installer and runtime builders as app setup. It starts with no engine
directory, downloads pinned source archives over HTTPS, builds the executables,
executes their help command, and checks that optional engines share the model
store. It does **not** simulate a browser onboarding click. Existing user
checkouts, models, preferences and running processes are not replaced or stopped.

`test-first-launch-e2e` instead relocates the signed `.app`, starts its real
binary from `/` with an empty `DS4UI_DATA_DIR`, and uses headless WebKit to
operate the first-run installation controls. `DS4UI_TEST_MODE` is **not** set.
It clicks Install, chooses the optional models, and checks real setup responses,
pinned revisions, compiled executable startup, automatic checkout selection,
shared model storage and discovery after reload. It also reverses/reapplies the
complete six-patch main runtime stack on a private source copy and requires exact
file preservation. An existing engine-port listener (or a test-owned sentinel)
must survive installation and test shutdown.

Only `/api/model/download` is intentionally refused at the browser boundary,
**after** actual optional-engine setup; weights are not downloaded and inference
is not counted as tested by this gate. Model-start attempts are also blocked.
No setup/build/catalog response is simulated. This is headless application/UI
coverage, not Finder double-click, native title-bar, or native file-picker QA.
Evidence and screenshots are retained in `tests/.artifacts/first-launch-*/`.

To follow a successful setup with real loading of every supported installed GGUF:

```sh
node tests/live/installed_models_e2e.mjs tests/.artifacts/first-launch-<successful-run> ds4/gguf
```

This heavyweight gate requires the existing inference engine to be stopped
explicitly. It uses the freshly built runtimes and links their empty task-owned
GGUF directory to existing weights, without copying or moving them. Models are
loaded **one at a time**, with 8k context, DSpark off, resident Qwen/Laguna and
SSD expert streaming for main DeepSeek/GLM models. Qwen3.8 keeps its native SSD
PLE. Each model must become ready, return exact arithmetic and JSON extraction
answers through DStudio, then answer a checked prompt through the real Chat UI,
including completed SSE and visible rendered text. No response is mocked.
Auxiliary GGUFs and unsupported models are listed separately; missing weights,
timeouts, truncated answers and failed checks are not passes. This does not
qualify all quantizations, maximum context, vision, Agent or Cowork behavior.

The inference gate starts a real `ds4-server`, waits for its live model catalog,
and checks arithmetic, structured extraction, ordering, Unicode, multi-turn
recall, longer-context lookup, code reasoning, malformed-request recovery and
actual SSE completion. Expected answers are independently checked, not supplied
by a model judge. Missing weights, a failed build, truncation and wrong answers
fail the run. No nonempty-answer-only pass criteria.
The tool check requires a real model-generated function call and correct use of
a controlled tool result; it does not claim autonomous execution of an Agent.

The Qwen Chat gate uses an isolated DStudio data directory, invokes the actual
launch API, rejects reuse of an unrelated engine, and sends the same checked
tasks through DStudio's Chat proxy. It does not simulate a browser click.

Each unique run retains requests, responses, failures, exact install receipts,
binary SHA-256, model path/size/mtime, load time and response time under
`tests/.artifacts/engine-acceptance/`. No model content is committed. Timings
describe this run, not a universal speed benchmark. The acceptance checks are
not full-logit comparisons against BF16/CPU, and do not establish general model
quality, tool-use quality, CUDA parity or exhaustive context-boundary correctness.

Both Qwen integrations currently have **Chat/native inference** integration. Their different tool
syntax is not yet adapted to DStudio Agent/Cowork/Design, so those modes reject
them explicitly. Only Qwen3.8 needs the SSD-backed PLE file. Qwen3.6 uses the
31.8 GB Q6_K_XL file, without PLE or expert SSD streaming. Its disk KV checkpoint
path is disabled until the fork can serialize its complete recurrent state.

For a fresh Qwen3.6 source/build check (including its primary-store dependency):

```sh
node tests/live/engine_acceptance.mjs --setup --engines main,qwen35
make test-engine-setup-unit test-qwen35-download
# Use the empty-model fresh-install path printed by the setup run:
node tests/integration/qwen35_setup_http_test.mjs path/from-setup-output/fresh-install
# Explicit, heavyweight; requires installed Qwen3.6 weights. Not run for this integration:
node tests/live/engine_acceptance.mjs --infer --engines qwen35 --via-app
```

The integration was checked with real source builds, real setup/catalog/checkout
HTTP calls and small-file download tests, not real-model inference. The Qwen3.8 published throughput and answer
results must not be attributed to Qwen3.6.

## Local regression suite

### Vision encoder with SSD streaming (real Metal)

```sh
make test-vision-streaming-live
# Optional existing source/encoder locations:
make test-vision-streaming-live VISION_DS4_DIR=/path/to/ds4 VISION_ENCODER=/path/to/encoder.gguf
```

This explicit, bounded regression clones the pinned local Git source into an
ignored test directory and maps only the installed 933 MB DeepSeek Vision-Exp
encoder. It does not launch a language model, restart the app or touch downloads.
Real Metal kernels encode a synthetic image and route text/image token IDs before
and after three alternating language-weight span replacements. The unpatched
build must reproduce six mapping failures; the patched build must preserve the
exact encoder and routing outputs on all six checks. Baseline output hashes must
also match between the separate unpatched/patched builds. Patch apply/restore is
checked twice, with exact tracked-source restoration.

Logs, engine revision and the run receipt remain under
`tests/.artifacts/vision-stream-*/`. Missing hardware/weights or a failure is not
counted as a pass. This verifies the reproduced memory-mapping regression, not
full PDF comprehension, end-to-end LLM inference or BF16 reference equivalence.
The native fix takes effect only when a rebuilt engine is started; this test
cannot update an already-running process.

### Small SSD prefill batches (real Metal, 128k context)

```sh
make test-ssd-prefill-batch-live
# Optional existing checkout (default installed Vision-Exp weights under gguf/):
make test-ssd-prefill-batch-live SSD_TEST_DS4_DIR=/path/to/ds4
# Or specify existing GGUF and encoder explicitly:
node tests/live/ssd_prefill_batch_test.mjs /path/to/ds4 /path/to/model.gguf /path/to/encoder.gguf
```

This sequential test reproduces the DStudio GLM/M2 port's DeepSeek regression:
the old port rejects a batch with more than eight distinct experts, although
each token selects only six. It builds clean, task-owned engine sources and
checks that the production migration fixes both the real Metal kernel and the
real first transformer layer. Nothing restarts the app, copies/downloads weights
or changes user preferences. Each layer process has a 60-second deadline and
loads layer 0 only, with 131072 context, SSD on and a 256-expert cache (about
4.17 GiB planned GPU allocation on the tested Flash model).

- Four synthetic GPU batches check every result against an **exact CPU oracle**:
  12, 30 and 384 distinct experts, plus GLM's eight experts per token. Invalid
  per-token counts 0/9 and resource count 385 remain rejected.
- Six real-weight cases (1, 2, 139, 760, 761 and 1024 tokens) check **every output
  float bit-for-bit against upstream without the GLM/M2 port**. This covers the
  reported 139-token failure and both sides of the selected-address boundary.
- The legacy binaries must reproduce the specific kernel/layer failures; a
  timeout or missing dependency cannot satisfy the negative test. Existing
  GLM top-8/cache numerical tests run as well.

Logs, patch/engine identity, raw layer outputs and hashes are retained in
ignored `tests/.artifacts/ssd-prefill-*/`. This is a numerical layer regression,
**not** full-model inference, PDF comprehension, a 128k-token input test, BF16
equivalence or a speed benchmark. The context allocation is 128k; each tested
input contains at most 1024 tokens.

`make test-glm53-m2max-patch` also exercises fresh apply/restore and installed
legacy migration, with dry checks, partial-state refusal and unrelated-edit
preservation. Native readiness and the PLD builder tests verify that Metal-only
source changes invalidate old binaries. Frontend behavior tests verify that a
generic prefill failure is no longer mislabeled as an out-of-memory diagnosis.

### Model-free checks

For PDF evidence, run `make test-pdf-evidence`, also with
`DSTUDIO_TEST_BROWSER=webkit`. This uses real synthetic PDFs, the native HTTP
endpoint and Poppler to verify passage matching, render geometry and clickable
links. Repeated labels retain all distinct passages in a modal chooser; no
unattached source or ambiguous calculation is silently accepted. Choosing a
different page aborts the old request and a delayed reply cannot replace the
current image/highlights. Invalid/truncated metadata is hidden with an honest
warning. The full-app attachment browser test separately verifies streaming and
chat reload with repeated labels (simulated model answer, no inference).

`make check-fast` runs local functional/browser/integration tests without a
large language model. `make test-cowork`, `make test-frontend-unit`,
`make test-pdf-evidence` and `make test-pld` select narrower suites. Stateful test
doubles remain useful for failure/recovery coverage but are labeled as such.
`make test-video-open-weight` is separate: it compiles and runs a small real
Metal attention-equivalence probe and requires the installed H3 checkout.

Settings and model-switch regressions can also run in WebKit (the browser engine
used by the macOS app):

```sh
node tests/browser/ui_settings_redesign_playwright_test.mjs
DSTUDIO_TEST_BROWSER=webkit node tests/browser/ui_settings_redesign_playwright_test.mjs
```

Both require the corresponding Playwright browser installed. They click Done
with invalid fields in hidden panes and exercise Qwen/DeepSeek/GLM selection,
SSD preferences, cancellation, duplicate clicks, delayed preparation, stale
readiness, progress and launch errors. Background download progress and paused
state remain in Settings while the composer retains the model name, including
after a reload; these display-only interactions must issue no engine/download
mutations. Filtering/refreshing the model list also preserves the selected
download target; the confirmed request must name that exact model, not the first
option in the refreshed list. Loading visibility is hit-tested in the browser. The launcher
responses are simulated; no weights are loaded and these
tests do not measure inference. Screenshots go under `tests/.artifacts/`.

The composer model picker has its own browser regression:

```sh
node tests/browser/ui_model_picker_playwright_test.mjs
DSTUDIO_TEST_BROWSER=webkit node tests/browser/ui_model_picker_playwright_test.mjs
```

It searches installed models by name/quantization, excludes manual engine-branch
choices and support files, checks keyboard navigation and viewport fit in both
themes, and verifies that selecting Qwen chooses its matching engine before
launching. Catalog delays/errors and background download polling must preserve
search input and focus. The launcher is simulated; this is not real inference.
Screenshots and the request receipt go under `tests/.artifacts/model-picker/`.

The old source-pattern contract files were removed. Their useful parser, LAN,
Markdown and browser checks were retained as behavioral tests. Build-failure
injection tests cover cleanup and source preservation, not compiler correctness;
real first-run builds provide that separate evidence.

See the [real-run report](../docs/ENGINE_ACCEPTANCE.md) for actual failures as well
as successes. Qwen native generation throughput is reported separately from
DStudio Chat latency and from the small cross-engine acceptance battery.
