# DStudio originals

Twenty-five original visual systems replace the downloaded design catalog. They ship
with the repository and macOS/Windows support bundle, without a first-run
design download. Runtime/model dependencies retain their required notices.

| System | Composition | Starting point |
|---|---|---|
| Folio | Issue rail, expressive serif, reading column and marginal index | Publications, research |
| Signal | Compact navigation, operational rows, tabular readings | Tools, operations, data |
| Forma | Large sans statement, unequal project areas, structural whitespace | Portfolios, showcases |
| Grove | Humanist type, welcome beside one focused action | Services, learning, onboarding |
| Pulse | Condensed poster type, hard rules, practical timetable | Cultural programmes, events |
| Market | Product shelves, filter rail, side-by-side comparison and itemized basket | Catalogs, configurators |
| Commons | Community rail, discussion stream, profiles and reversible review queue | Communities, collaboration |
| Atlas | Synchronized schematic map and place list, editable itinerary | Place directories, guides |
| Canvas | Central artboard, object tools, inspector and bounded undo/redo | Editors, creative workspaces |
| Ledger | Ruled entries, tabular amounts, running balance and reconciliation | Budgets, statements, invoices |
| Relay | Conversation index, reading-led transcript and local reply composer | Correspondence, messaging |
| Docket | Ruled task lanes, selected-item inspector and explicit work limit | Task boards, work queues |
| Tempo | Track library, transport, seek and volume with honest playback state | Media libraries, audio interfaces |
| Transit | Departure rows, named lines and ordered journey legs | Timetables, journey planners |
| Hearth | Room tabs, named device switches and bounded temperature controls | Home/device control interfaces |
| Manual | Section index, exact selectable code, parameters and feedback | Documentation, technical references |
| Larder | Scalable quantities, ingredient checklist and current cooking step | Recipes, procedural guides |
| Depot | Stock rows, reorder levels, bin detail and validated movements | Inventory, stock management |
| Roster | Person/day shifts, coverage gaps and explicit rest constraints | Shift planning, leave management |
| Pipeline | Stage filters, deal dossier and factual activity timeline | Sales workflows, relationship management |
| Tally | Invoice register, editable draft lines and consistent totals | Billing, invoices |
| Letter | Reading-led proposition, benefits, price sentence and named action | Editorial landing pages |
| Datasheet | Revision/specification rows, comparisons and plan table | Technical product landing pages |
| Walkthrough | Guided steps synchronized with a drawn product view | Product demonstrations, onboarding |
| Counter | Input-driven quote, breakdown and selected plan | Pricing/configuration landing pages |

These are visual vocabularies, not universal page templates. Task and audience
determine hierarchy, typography and interaction. Explicit user choices win.

Market, Commons, Atlas and Canvas include working offline examples, not four
recolors of one page. Their cart, replies, route and object edits are local to the
preview and disappear on reload. They do not make purchases, publish content,
provide live directions or save a project. Canvas supports pointer dragging,
keyboard movement and inspector edits with 30 undo states and a 12-object limit.

The earlier nine-pack browser gate passed in Chromium and WebKit, including light/dark,
320/390/768/1440px, 200% text, form validation, dialog focus return, choice-label
geometry and actual domain controls. Direct local-file exports also work without
DStudio APIs. These are authored component tests, **not model-generated output
quality**. The planned 18 generated projects and final desktop qualification are
still pending. A visual review caught split tool-label words in Canvas; a rendered
regression reproduced the problem before the toolbar correction. Another
regression caught keyboard focus leaving the inspector on a different object;
Canvas now selects the focused object before arrow-key edits. Removing the final
Market basket row also retains focus inside its dialog.

The eighteen frozen briefs for the original nine systems are in
[`tests/fixtures/design_pack_projects.json`](../tests/fixtures/design_pack_projects.json),
with two distinct interaction scenarios for every system. The native generator
can select this corpus via `DESIGN_COMPARE_SUITE`; it freezes the complete
briefs, executable, packs and full selected-weight hash, and records whether the
requested pack's actual bytes were returned by the native tool. A tool name or
the model saying it used a system is insufficient. No generated project from this
corpus is yet qualified: the dedicated eighteen-scenario browser audit is being
implemented; full oracle qualification, real generation and screenshot review
remain outstanding. The historical three-brief
auditor explicitly rejects this new corpus instead of silently skipping its
interactions and returning a misleading pass.

## October 1 integration and guidance

The supplied DStudio archive adds sixteen systems and revises the original nine.
Its SHA-256 is `3b377ac045bcecb2796f9f7d92b2354e33cc58e3b315cd52c9e6bf273bef7bfa`.
Only design-system resources and the catalog were imported; unrelated loading,
sidebar/chat mockups, uploads and archive support scripts were not installed.
The native host, pack dispatcher and bundled/offline checks expose the same
25 supported IDs. Missing resources remain explicit failures, without downloads.

All 25 `DESIGN.md` and recipe files now distinguish the visual starting point,
explicit user constraints, domain state invariants and observable acceptance.
The eight craft guides use adaptable type/layout/color choices, source-grounded
content, keyboard/reflow checks and stable reading/selection during updates.
Contrast and target guidance links to the applicable W3C explanations; these
checks are not accessibility certification. Local/system font availability and
explicit user choices remain authoritative.

The native Design prompt instructs the agent to load `craft("state-coverage")`
before substantial work; the pack dispatcher exposes
[`references/design-plan.md`](../extension/craft/state-coverage/references/design-plan.md)
through `pack_file`. The project plan records actual facts, primary action,
topology, token/font bindings, reflow, action/validation/result/failure behavior,
persistence and independently checked exports. A plan or model self-review is
not evidence of delivery. Packs/craft remain loaded on demand, not embedded as
one complete catalog in startup. Instruction adherence on model-generated work
has not been measured in this integration.

The preview checks exercise actual controls for the sixteen added domains, as
well as the existing examples. Relay retains at most 20 new replies per
conversation and Pipeline 20 new activities per deal, each up to 1000 JavaScript
string units. Admission failure retains prior content and the typed draft.
Depot bounds stock to 0–999999 whole units and 32 retained movements per bin;
invalid/unsafe adjustments cannot change stock or history. Roster checks the
11-hour demonstration constraint in both adjacent-day directions, including
cross-midnight shifts; it is not a legal or complete workforce scheduler.
Tally retains valid totals and blocks sending while a draft quantity is invalid.

WebKit resize tests reproduced width defects in Forma, Atlas and Letter. Explicit
shrinkable media tracks/widths and a naturally sized billing legend repair the
containers without clipping content. Original failing browser receipts and
separate harness corrections remain in ignored artifacts. Current integration
verification is recorded below; no model inference is part of these checks.

Model-free verification on October 1:

| Command | Scope and result |
| --- | --- |
| `make test-design-originals` | 402/402 checks passed: native catalog and unavailable resources; Chromium/WebKit controls, both themes, four widths, 200% text, opaque frames and offline exports |
| `DSTUDIO_TEST_BROWSER=chromium node tests/browser/ui_agent_design_playwright_test.mjs` | Passed with simulated services; gallery and selection of the sixteen new systems |
| `DSTUDIO_TEST_BROWSER=webkit node tests/browser/ui_agent_design_playwright_test.mjs` | Passed with the same simulated service scope |
| `make test-design-runtime test-design-bench-validate test-design-release` | Passed; native pack/plan dispatch, recovery, controls, cancellation/resume, audit regressions and existing recorded benchmark/release checks |
| `make test-macos-bundle` | Passed; packaged catalog and bundled resources, without opening the user's app |

The preview report retains 200 distinct Chromium screenshots and rendered contrast
observations for both browsers. Visual review used contact sheets of all 25 light
desktop and dark mobile examples; these show the upper composition, not every
state or the full page. Automated layout/control checks are separate. No weights,
real generation or new quality benchmark ran. Existing benchmark validation only
checks its recorded fixtures/baselines and is not a fresh inference result.

The existing eighteen-project corpus remains frozen, with its original nine-system
identities and failure denominator. It does not cover generated output for the
sixteen added systems. Those require separate future briefs/oracles and actual
model runs; importing them does not resume the paused completion campaign.

## What the agent receives

Each `extension/design-systems/<id>/` contains:

- `DESIGN.md`: direction, adaptation rules, states and acceptance checks.
- `tokens.css`: coordinated light/dark roles and offline component primitives.
- `components.html`: original composition and interactive component view.
- `assets/preview.js`: local interactions, no network or persistence.
- `references/recipes.md`: composition, reflow, state and export guidance.

The native design_system tool lists these files; pack_file actually reads the
root CSS/HTML. Previously those paths were rejected despite instructions to use
them. Generated projects must copy their dependencies into their own workspace,
not rely on DStudio API URLs. The lab toolbar and fictional sample identity do
not belong in client deliverables.

The agent writes a short design-plan.md covering audience, primary action,
content priority, typography, topology, mobile reflow and interaction states.
This is guidance, not proof of good output.

A complete brief can start a planned build without an obligatory questionnaire
or an English skip phrase. Missing consequential decisions still warrant a
question; an actual question pauses the tool batch before later file changes.
The work-card prerequisite and artifact verification remain enforced.

Substantial projects can use local linked HTML/CSS/JS instead of one oversized
inline write. An incomplete tool batch never executes any of its calls and does
not undo earlier completed rounds. The agent receives a concrete recovery steer:
inspect saved files, retry smaller complete calls and preserve all requested
behavior. This does not raise generation limits or save truncated source.

The local loop also distinguishes a genuine EOS from exhaustion while still
drafting prose, including before the first todo. It can continue such a response
at most three times per user turn, with the same per-round token limit. Context
space for the continuation is checked explicitly. Exhausting that recovery bound
is recorded as incomplete, not successful delivery. This fixes the silent stop
exposed by the real workshop development run; its targeted replay is documented
separately from the initial comparison.

Source lint reads the entry's directly linked local CSS/JS as well as inline
styles/scripts. A source-only spelling change therefore does not hide focus or
motion rules, or produce warnings merely because `:root`/media queries live in
another file. A naturally reflowing page is judged by its rendered layout, not
by the presence of a media query. Dependency lint is bounded to 4 MiB and rejects
out-of-project paths; skipped/oversized inputs are explicitly unverified.
Nested imports and actual behavior still need browser/interaction checks: this
is not a complete CSS cascade or JavaScript analysis.

Text-only runtimes also tell the agent that pixel inspection is unavailable,
while `inspect_layout` and the deterministic render checks remain usable. This
prevents an instruction to repeatedly call an unavailable vision tool from
masquerading as visual verification. It does not turn geometry into perception.

## Quality without stylistic uniformity

The blanket hard failure for sans display fonts is removed: a valid Arial or
system-ui heading is not a defect by itself. Arbitrary two-line heroes,
accent percentages and section quotas no longer override the brief.
Counting CSS references to an accent or repeated hex values is no longer an
aesthetic warning either: neither measures painted area, contrast or hierarchy.
The live old-agent run exposed unnecessary extra inspection after this warning.
Color craft and the main prompt now agree with that policy: no fixed neutral/
accent percentages or blanket display-font blacklist. The scale and typography
roles come from the brief and the selected system. Accessibility guidance is a
practical baseline, not a claim of certification or legal compliance.

Exact-copy checking permits inline emphasis and spans within the requested
phrase. Useful typography must not be removed solely to satisfy a raw substring
search. Hidden copies, changed wording/spacing and fragments assembled across
separate sections or controls remain invalid. The native source check is bounded;
it is not a complete browser text/visibility engine.

Native verify_artifact and artifact now measure 1280/768/390px layouts even on
text-only models. Page overflow, control overlap and media distortion are P0
failures; missing rendering evidence is also a failure. Geometry is refreshed
even after CSS-only changes. The existing vision assessment remains separate.

Radio/checkbox label geometry is part of that native gate too: actual text
overlapping a visible indicator, or wrapped card text entering its column,
blocks delivery as P0. `inspect_layout` returns the label/control selectors and
the offending rendered text rectangle. The check covers visible native inputs
and an immediate `aria-hidden` indicator sibling; it does not infer arbitrary
pseudo-element controls. Plain inline labels and hidden content are excluded
from the card-column rule. Work is capped at 128 inputs, eight labels per input,
4,096 text nodes and 8,192 text rectangles; an exceeded scan is unverified, not
a pass. At most 12 detailed findings are returned.

Geometry is not an aesthetic score. A model's own critique is not an independent
quality benchmark. Real comparisons must operate the resulting interfaces.
See the [real-agent development experiment](DESIGN_AGENT_EXPERIMENT.md) for
observed output defects, regression derivation and comparison status.

A separate P1 readability warning now measures long paragraphs confined below
12em into at least six rendered lines. It reports actual selectors, font sizes,
widths and the containing grid/flex layout through inspect_layout. Short labels,
hidden content and explicit verse line breaks are excluded. This is an inspection
cue, not a blanket aesthetic veto or a required universal column width.

Rendered inspection also lists visible fragment links without a DOM destination.
Missing ordinary anchors produce a P1 warning with selectors/hrefs available in
`inspect_layout`. Valid named anchors, encoded IDs, top links and text fragments
are accepted, including destinations created by JavaScript. This is not a hash
router or full-navigation test: intentionally scripted routes require actual
interaction checks, not an automatic rejection based on an absent element ID.

## Migration

Catalog, preview endpoint, bootstrap listing and native pack loader expose only
the originals, even if an older installation retains imported directories.
An old saved style is cleared with a visible notice when the gallery loads;
an explicit API request for a retired style returns an error.
User skills, model weights, engine paths and existing projects are preserved.

POST /api/setup/content remains a compatibility check: complete bundled assets
succeed immediately; missing files return an actionable 409. It never downloads
a historical catalog or overwrites user files.

## Verification

- `make test-design-originals`: actual native catalog and incomplete-bundle
  behavior; Chromium/WebKit at 320/390/768/1440px, both palettes, search, form
  validation, dialogs and focus return, computed solid-color text contrast and
  200% text-only resizing. The same packs also run inside the app's opaque
  `allow-scripts allow-forms` iframe sandbox in both browser engines. No external
  requests. **No inference and not a comprehensive accessibility certification.**
  Also exercises catalog filters, variant basket quantities/totals, comparison
  limits, replies treated as literal text, membership/review changes, map/list
  selection, route ordering, object edits, cancelled drags, undo/redo and resource
  limits. The same domain controls run inside the opaque iframe. Independent
  `file:` exports load their own CSS/JS with HTTP requests blocked.
- `make test-design-self`: real pack dispatcher, returned CSS/HTML bytes,
  retired-id rejection, real Chrome overflow/CSS-only repair without a vision
  model, valid sans typography, cramped-prose measurements, truncated-batch file
  preservation, inline/linked source-lint equivalence and the existing runtime
  regressions. The local-source checks include missing files, comments that
  contain example URLs, symlink escapes, oversized files and non-file inputs.
  A real-browser navigation regression covers missing fragment destinations and
  a JavaScript-only repair, while preserving valid fragment forms.
  The radio regression reproduces inline-padding/absolute-indicator wrapping,
  proves the native delivery gate rejects it at all three widths, and checks
  that measured CSS-only repair clears the error without a vision model.
- `make test-design-tool-recovery`: the actual native agent loop receives
  deliberately truncated **simulated model frames**, preserves earlier writes
  and completes smaller retries with exact expected file bytes. No inference.
- `make test-design-archive-build`: a real build and executable startup from a
  local source archive without engine Git metadata, including isolation from a
  surrounding project's Git identity and invalidation after source edits. No
  model or network; this is not the fresh-network installation test.
- `make test-design-build-freshness`: the native owner and build script with a
  simulated compiler, testing private snapshots, failed links, stale sources,
  byte/configuration freshness, shared build leases and interrupted publication.
  Original engine sources, objects and unrelated files must remain intact.
- `node tests/browser/ui_agent_design_playwright_test.mjs`: app gallery,
  retired selection migration and existing workflows. Engine/catalog responses
  are **simulated**, separately from the original-pack tests.
- `make test-macos-bundle`: isolated packaged app, actual bundled catalog and
  offline setup endpoint. No model inference.

Real inference comparisons are explicit and sequential:

    node tests/live/design_originals_comparison.mjs LABEL BINARY ENGINE_DIR EXTENSION_DIR NEW_OUTPUT_DIR [DESIGN_SOURCE]
    node tests/support/design_comparison_audit.mjs NEW_OUTPUT_DIR
    node tests/support/design_comparison_report.mjs BEFORE_DIR AFTER_DIR NEW_OUTPUT_DIR

The report rejects partial or incompatible comparisons and distinguishes actual
delivery from the behavior of a partial page. `make test-design-comparison-report`
tests this accounting with synthetic receipts, not simulated claims of model
quality. Visual review of generated outputs remains a separate requirement.

The runner loads existing DeepSeek V4 Flash Chat IQ2XXS weights with Metal, fully
resident weights, 32k context, identical sampling/seed and three frozen briefs in
tests/fixtures/design_agent_originals.json. Before/after use captured binaries
linked to the same main engine revision, and separate original/retired pack trees;
never give both variants the new packs. Pass the captured old Design source for
the before receipt, rather than hashing the current source for both binaries.
Archive-based engine identities come from their source receipt, not a parent
DStudio Git checkout. An earlier Qwen attempt was interrupted without a delivered
artifact and is not quality evidence; the supported native Design path uses DS4.
Raw errors, timeouts, generated files and binary/model identity are retained.
A missing artifact is not a pass, even if partial HTML looks attractive.

For the new corpus, select it explicitly before the same native generation
command; `DESIGN_COMPARE_MODEL` can name an already-present model supported by
the chosen native Design engine. The runtime remains resident and never chooses
a different model or memory mode automatically. Keep heavyweight runs sequential
and verify that the selected configuration fits the shared host before launch.

```sh
DESIGN_COMPARE_SUITE=tests/fixtures/design_pack_projects.json \
DESIGN_COMPARE_MODEL=/path/to/already-present-model.gguf \
node tests/live/design_originals_comparison.mjs LABEL BINARY ENGINE_DIR EXTENSION_DIR NEW_OUTPUT_DIR
```

`DESIGN_COMPARE_CASES` is an explicitly recorded diagnostic subset, not completion
of the eighteen-project requirement. Generation receipts carry `qualityStatus:
not_reviewed`; idle state, a saved file and successful pack loading do not establish
functional or visual quality. Do not use the legacy three-brief auditor or report
as the missing new audit.

Native capture now drains both output pipes and closes the owned process/logs
before validating the exact registered file. A malformed JSON event, failed
write, incomplete log or cleanup failure cannot pass just because HTML exists.
Raw prefixes and byte counts are retained if an explicit resource limit is hit;
capture has bounded lines/events and one filesystem write in flight per pipe.
The process gate uses simulated native events and real subprocess/file errors,
not model inference. Generation time and teardown time are separate, and a
comparison rejects mismatched capture settings or harness revisions.

The new independent auditor is
[`design_project_audit.mjs`](../tests/support/design_project_audit.mjs). It keeps
original exports immutable, rejects symlinks and out-of-project requests, and
separates functional checks from pending screenshot review. Its matrix includes
Chromium/WebKit, both themes, four widths, 200% text, local-file exports and an
opaque preview harness (not native desktop qualification). **It is still in
development**: `make test-design-project-auditor` qualifies the shared pipeline,
editorial search/dialog, per-essay reading states/notes, repair-queue states,
incident assignment/resolution and
deliberate broken-control/layout fixtures. It checks distinct essay bodies,
literal independent notes, real empty/error recovery, item-specific details,
unapplied drafts, independent assignees, live counts and complete ordered history;
the other fourteen scenarios still require positive/negative oracle tests and
review before their generated-project results can be accepted.

The auditor also preserves errors reported while a page is closing. A view
cannot pass merely because its last interaction finished before a late script
error arrived. `make test-design-project-resources` verifies this and bounded
error floods in real Chromium/WebKit: retained evidence has count/byte limits,
overload fails the view, and unrelated browser contexts remain open. Native
dialog closure is awaited within the original action deadline, not inferred
from completion of the Escape key dispatch. These checks validate the tester,
not generated design quality; original failed receipts remain available.

```sh
node tests/support/design_project_audit.mjs COMPLETED_GENERATION_DIR
```

An incomplete run requires `--completed-only` and retains all eighteen cases in
its denominator. It cannot become a full passing quality receipt. Test-fixture
screenshots are not generated project examples or published benchmark evidence.

## Defects found by the original-pack tests

- Enlarged mobile text could force a grid past the viewport. Shrinkable children,
  wrapping and responsive day choices now preserve content instead of clipping it.
- WebKit blocked relative CSS/JS inside the opaque preview iframe: its CSP `self`
  did not match the sandbox origin. Original-pack responses now name that pack's
  explicit resource URLs. The sandbox remains unchanged; no CDN scripts or remote
  design assets are enabled by this fix.
- The first real old-agent archive passed search/dialog and page-overflow checks,
  but its third paragraph occupied a 96px column at 1440px (17px type, 13 lines).
  A grid `order` change had put the prose in the number rail; on mobile its button
  also appeared before the title. A native real-browser regression now exercises
  cramped prose plus CSS-only repair. The comparison outputs themselves remain
  untouched; working controls alone are not counted as good composition.

Generated evidence and the recoverable retired-catalog snapshot stay under
ignored tests/.artifacts/. Do not publish claims of measured aesthetic
improvement until the actual before/after outputs have been reviewed.

Historical original-pack receipt: `tests/.artifacts/design-originals-g514nT/`:
32 aggregate checks passed, 40 screenshots, 2610 computed text-color pairs
across both engines/themes and example/component/dialog views. Desktop/light
and mobile/dark compositions were visually inspected; this is a local preview
review, not a score for the model. The app UI test (simulated engine/catalog),
build-freshness test and isolated signed macOS bundle smoke also passed.
Archive compilation/freshness passed (`tests/.artifacts/design-archive-build-20260905.log`).
Native interruption checks passed
(`tests/.artifacts/design-runtime-20260905-linked-final.log`).
Earlier native self-test and truncated-frame recovery passed
(`tests/.artifacts/design-navigation-regression-final-20260905.log`,
`tests/.artifacts/design-tool-recovery-78TRJz/`). The rebuilt isolated bundle
passed (`tests/.artifacts/design-navigation-bundle-20260905.log`).

After the generation-limit fix, the native self-test and report-accounting tests
passed (`tests/.artifacts/design-generation-limit-regression-20260905.log`),
followed by remote-frame recovery and the rebuilt isolated bundle
(`tests/.artifacts/design-generation-limit-bundle-20260905.log`). The explicit
EOS/continuation decision tests do not replace the targeted real-model replay.

`tests/live/design_generation_limit_test.mjs` provides a separate explicit
real-weight fault-injection check with a one-token per-round allowance. It tests
the native cutoff/retry/terminal boundary, not the quality of a deliberately
unfinished response. It must run sequentially, never alongside another model.

## Final verification — September 6, 2026

- `make test-design-runtime` passed, including the inline-heading regressions,
  native rendered checks, truncated-frame recovery, original packs, interruption
  and resume: `tests/.artifacts/design-final-runtime-20260906.log`.
- The app gallery test passed with simulated engine/catalog responses:
  `tests/.artifacts/design-final-ui-20260906.log`.
- The rebuilt, signed macOS bundle passed its isolated startup, actual catalog
  and offline content check: `tests/.artifacts/design-final-bundle-20260906.log`.
  Its Design source hash and all 25 original-pack files match the working tree.
  The user's open app was not restarted. Windows packaging includes the packs,
  but no Windows execution was performed on this Mac.
- The explicit real-weight cutoff test passed in
  `tests/.artifacts/design-generation-limit-live-OYRmV8/`. The captured old binary
  reproduces the silent-success bug in `design-generation-limit-live-n0LDQq/`.
  The first corrected-binary receipt (`design-generation-limit-live-BTfzdq/`)
  is retained as failed: its recovery/status checks succeeded, but the test
  incorrectly treated runtime-generated `MEMORY.MD` as model-created content.
  The final test explicitly checks that summary's idle/no-artifact state and
  still requires exact preservation of the preexisting file and no tool calls.

Final native Design source SHA-256:
`87acb241eb2f7ca4aecf2a7eb407a6ed6c37930475801081c315d1813e4e2bd9`.
These passing regression checks do not erase the mixed initial real-agent
comparison. The workshop-only replay and its limitations are documented in
[the experiment](DESIGN_AGENT_EXPERIMENT.md).
